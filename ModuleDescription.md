This module was built and designed to make generating the JSON structure for Teams Adaptive Cards easier. The JSON formatting for Adaptive cards is clunky at the best of times, and as a result building it dynamically in a function can be extremely challenging. This Module uses .NET custom classes to make this work as well as establishing dedicated objects that are used to ensure the formatting is properly preserved and created.

# Teams-BuildAdaptiveCards

Adaptive cards are challenging to say the least. Mostly, this is due to how the JSON is incredible intolerant of errors. This makes coding around it, time consuming and frustrating. This set of functions, seeks to work around that using the power of Classes, and the logic of powershell to break things down. This started as something I needed to create for usage with some Azure Function logic, and then slowly evolved overtime, I hope you find it useful.
